# Revideo Minimal Starter Template

This is a minimal Revideo starter project. It can be bootstrapped using
`npm init @revideo@latest` and selecting the minimal template.

It includes a simple scene with a background video, music and the Revideo logo.
You can get started by editing the `project.tsx` file in the `src` folder.

You can run the Revideo editor using `npm start` and render the final video
using `npm run render`.

If you want to see what's possible with Revideo, check out the other templates

If you want to include your Revideo project in a website, you can use the
